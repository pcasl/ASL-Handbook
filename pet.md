The ASL images were compared the PET, which is used as the golden standar, although the contrast information of the two are different. 

Bokkers et al. [^1] performed a study using STAR and Look-Locker seqeunce on 14 patients. ASL presented similar blood flow changes in the ICA occlusion patients as PET images. However, the absolute CBF was over estimated in ASL, and the the CBF ratio between the contra and ipsilateral hemisphere were also significantly different between ASL and PET.

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
