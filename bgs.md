# Background Suppression

In the early work of MR angiography, blood and vessel images were acheived by subtracting a pair of images with and without labeled blood. When the background signal is not stable, the subtraction results in non-blood signal. Therefore, multiple inversion RFs were used to reduce the static tissue signal. 

One of the earliest work was presented by Nishmura et al. [^1]
